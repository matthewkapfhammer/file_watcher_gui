File watcher GUI
================

The File Contents Watcher application allows you to load text-based files such as application or website log files and view them while they are being updated by your application or website. The application monitors the file for changes and automatically reloads the files if they are modified.

There are other applications available that display text-based files and automatically reload them when they are modified. An example of such a program is UltraEdit which I am currently using to write the first draft of this article. However, these programs are not written with the main purpose of monitoring a group of text files for changes and presenting them as a group. That's where the File Contents Watcher program comes in.
